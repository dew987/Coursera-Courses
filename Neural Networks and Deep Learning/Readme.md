**Course Name:- Neural Networks and Deep Learning by DeepLearning.AI**

**Instructor:- Andrew NG**

**Course Overview:-**
The Neural Networks and Deep Learning course is the first course in the Deep Learning Specialization by Deeplearning.ai. It consists of four weeks of in-depth content, covering the basics of neural networks, gradient descent, forward and backward propagation, and building a deep neural network. The course utilized a combination of instructional videos, quizzes, and programming assignments to reinforce the concepts and enhance hands-on learning.

**Key Learnings:-**

1. Introduction to Neural Networks: I learned about the basic building blocks of neural networks, including neurons, activation functions, and the architecture 
of a single-layer neural network. I gained a clear understanding of how neural networks can model complex non-linear relationships in data.

2. Logistic Regression as a Neural Network: This module introduced me to logistic regression as a binary classification algorithm and its relation to neural 
networks. I learned about the forward and backward propagation steps, as well as how to compute the cost and update the parameters using gradient descent.

3. Shallow Neural Networks: This section delved deeper into the concept of shallow neural networks, which contain one hidden layer. I learned about the
activation functions used in neural networks (sigmoid, tanh, and ReLU) and their impact on model performance. I also gained insights into parameter initialization,
forward and backward propagation for hidden layers, and the importance of hyperparameter tuning.

4. Deep Neural Networks: This module expanded on shallow neural networks and introduced deep neural networks with multiple hidden layers. I learned about the 
forward and backward propagation steps in deep networks, as well as the challenges of training deep models, such as vanishing/exploding gradients. Techniques 
like parameter initialization, gradient checking, and regularization were discussed in detail.

5. Building Your Deep Neural Network: In this final module, I learned how to put all the concepts together and build a deep neural network from scratch 
using a step-by-step approach. I gained hands-on experience with implementing forward and backward propagation, parameter initialization, and gradient descent 
optimization. The course also covered techniques to improve model performance, including mini-batch gradient descent and random mini-batches.
